def island_perimeter(grid):
    """
    Calculate the perimeter of an island described by the given grid.

    Args:
    grid (list of list of int): A grid representing the island, where
    0 represents water and 1 represents land.

    Returns:
    int: The perimeter of the island.

    Notes:
    - Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
    - The grid is rectangular, with width and height not exceeding 100.
    - The grid is completely surrounded by water.
    - There is only one island (or nothing).
    - The island doesnâ€™t have "lakes" (water inside that isnâ€™t connected to
    the water surrounding the island).
